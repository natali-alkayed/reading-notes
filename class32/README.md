## Context API - Behaviors:

useReducer and useContext are two hooks provided by React that work together to simplify state management in a React application, especially when dealing with complex or global state.

- useReducer is a hook that allows you to manage state in a more structured and predictable way than using useState, especially when state updates depend on the previous state. It follows the same concept as the Redux pattern, where state transitions are defined by specifying actions and reducers. It takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state. The reducer function defines how the state should transition based on the action type and payload. This helps avoid directly mutating the state and enforces a clear separation of concerns.


- useContext is a hook that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. When combined with useReducer, it becomes a powerful tool for managing global state in a more elegant way. You can create a context using createContext and then provide the state and dispatch function obtained from useReducer as values to the context. This allows any component within the context's provider to access the state and dispatch without prop drilling.

By using both useReducer and useContext together, you can create a centralized state management system. The useReducer helps maintain the state transition logic in a single place, making it easier to reason about and test. Meanwhile, useContext ensures that any component that needs access to this state can simply consume it without the need to pass data through multiple levels of props. This approach is particularly beneficial for larger applications with complex state structures or when multiple components need access to the same state. However, it's important to note that using this combination might be overkill for smaller projects with simple state management needs, in which case useState and prop drilling could still be sufficient.

In summary, useReducer and useContext are powerful tools that, when used together, provide an efficient and maintainable way to manage global or complex state in a React application. They promote a more organized structure, separation of concerns, and reduced prop drilling, resulting in cleaner and more manageable code.
