## Project Idea 1: Task Management System

### Description:
Develop a task management system that allows users to create, update, and manage their tasks. The system should have user authentication and authorization in place to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their tasks. Each task can have a title, description, due date, priority level, and status (e.g., "in progress," "completed," etc.). Users should be able to view their own tasks, mark tasks as completed, update task details, and delete tasks. Additionally, the system can provide a dashboard view to display tasks based on their priority or due date.

### Possible Features:

1. User registration and login functionality.
2. Secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or  session-based authentication.
3. Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes or actions.
4. RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
5. Task filtering and sorting options based on priority or due date.
6. User-friendly interface to interact with the system, either through a web application or a command-line interface.

## Project Idea 2: Recipe Sharing Platform

### Description:
Create a recipe sharing platform that allows users to share and discover new recipes. Users can create an account, log in, and manage their own recipes. Each recipe should have a title, description, ingredients, instructions, and an optional image. Users can browse and search for recipes, save their favorite recipes, and leave comments on recipes. The platform should implement authentication and authorization to ensure that only logged-in users can create, update, or delete their own recipes.

### Possible Features:

1. User registration and login functionality.
2. Secure authentication using JWT or session-based authentication.
3. Role-based access control to differentiate between regular users and administrators.
4. RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes.
5. Recipe search functionality based on title, ingredients, or tags.
6. User profiles to showcase recipes created by each user.
7. Social features such as liking, commenting, and saving recipes.
8. Integration with a third-party API to retrieve       additional recipe details or nutritional information.



Both of these project ideas provide opportunities to implement authentication and authorization, perform CRUD operations using an API server, and demonstrate understanding of database operations. You can choose the idea that aligns better with your interests and explore additional features to make it more robust and engaging.
