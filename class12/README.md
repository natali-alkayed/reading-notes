# Socket.io
1. What is a Web Socket?

     A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection.

    It allows real-time, bi-directional data transfer, enabling instant updates and event-driven communication between web browsers and servers.

    WebSockets use a standardized protocol and provide a more efficient alternative to traditional HTTP polling for real-time web applications.

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
    1. The WebSocket handshake begins with a regular HTTP or HTTPS request from the client to the server.
    2. If the server supports WebSocket, it responds with a 101 Switching Protocols HTTP status code, upgrading the connection to the WebSocket protocol.
    3. Once the WebSocket connection is established, both the client and server can send messages back and forth in real-time without the overhead of HTTP headers, allowing for efficient, bi-directional communication.

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

### Socket.io Tutorial
1. What does the event handler io.on() do?.

    The event handler `io.on()` in the context of a WebSocket library like Socket.IO is used to listen for incoming events from the client.
    It allows the server to handle and respond to various events triggered by the client, such as connecting, disconnecting, or custom events.
    By defining event handlers using `io.on()`, the server can execute specific code or logic in response to these events.

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
    1. Demonstrating expected functionality through unit tests that cover key code paths and edge cases can serve as proof of code working as expected.
    2. Conducting manual or automated integration tests to validate the behavior of the code in a realistic environment can provide proof of life.
    3. Obtaining feedback and positive reviews from users or stakeholders who have successfully used the code and experienced the desired outcomes can serve as proof that the code works as expected.

3. What does socket.emit() do?

    `socket.emit()` is used to send a custom event with data from the server to the client in real-time using WebSockets.

### Socket.io vs Web Sockets
1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

    WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a standardized way for real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server.
    Socket.IO is a library built on top of WebSocket that adds additional features such as automatic reconnection, event-based messaging, and broader browser compatibility.
    In essence, WebSocket is the underlying protocol, while Socket.IO is a higher-level library that extends WebSocket functionality and simplifies development.

2. When would you use Socket.IO?

    Socket.IO is commonly used in scenarios where real-time, bidirectional communication is required between a client and a server. Here are some situations where Socket.IO can be beneficial:

    1. Chat applications: Socket.IO's event-based messaging and real-time capabilities make it well-suited for building chat applications where instant message delivery is crucial.

    2. Collaborative editing: Socket.IO can be used to enable real-time collaboration features in applications such as code editors, document editors, or whiteboards, where multiple users need to see live updates and changes.

    3. Real-time analytics: Socket.IO allows for seamless real-time data streaming, making it useful for applications that involve real-time analytics, monitoring, or dashboards that require continuous updates.

    4. Multiplayer gaming: Socket.IO's bidirectional communication enables the development of multiplayer games where real-time interactions among players are essential.

    Overall, Socket.IO is a versatile tool that simplifies the implementation of real-time communication features in various web and mobile applications.

3. When would you use WebSockets?

    WebSockets are commonly used in the following scenarios:

    1. Real-time applications: WebSockets are ideal for building real-time applications that require instant data updates, such as stock tickers, social media feeds, live chat, or collaborative tools.

    2. Push notifications: WebSockets enable efficient push notifications to be sent from a server to a client in real-time, ensuring timely delivery of important updates or notifications.

    3. Interactive web experiences: WebSockets can enhance interactive web experiences by enabling bi-directional communication between the client and server, allowing for seamless updates and interactions without the need for frequent page refreshes or manual AJAX polling.
