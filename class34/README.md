## API Integration
### Review API Server Build:
The API server build refers to the process of creating and setting up a server that exposes endpoints to allow communication between different software applications. It involves defining routes, handling requests and responses, and ensuring the server operates reliably and securely.

### Query String Parameter vs. Path Parameter:

* Query String Parameter: It’s a parameter passed in the URL after a question mark (?), used for optional data like filters or search terms. Example: http://example.com/api/resource?filter=keyword.

* Path Parameter: It’s a parameter embedded within the URL path, used to specify a resource or identifier directly. Example: http://example.com/api/resource/123.

### API URL with Path ID Parameter: Given the information provided, the API URL with a path ID parameter for the “stuff” model and “things” ID would be: http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things.

### Dynamic API with an “Interface” Explanation: Imagine the API interface like a menu at a restaurant. It’s like a user-friendly way for different computer programs to order exactly what they need from the kitchen (the server). The menu (interface) lists the dishes (endpoints), and each dish (endpoint) has options (parameters) you can customize. So, the interface helps programs communicate with the server and get the right data or perform actions easily.

### Review Auth Server Build:
Building an authentication server involves creating a system that manages user access. Middleware plays a crucial role in this. To implement basic authentication, you’d use middleware to check usernames and passwords. For bearer authentication, middleware verifies a token for secure access.

### Using Middleware for Basic and Bearer Auth:

For Basic Auth, middleware checks if the provided username and password match a database entry before granting access.
For Bearer Auth, middleware validates the token in the request header to ensure it’s valid and hasn’t expired.
OAuth Handshake Explanation: OAuth is like a secure digital handshake for apps. Imagine you want to log in to an app using your Google account. OAuth makes this possible by guiding the app and Google through a series of steps:

You ask the app to log in with Google.
The app directs you to Google, asking if it’s okay to share some info.
If you agree, Google sends a special key back to the app.
The app uses this key to access your info securely.
Role-Based Access Control Explanation: Think of Role-Based Access Control like different keys to a building. Each person (user) gets a key (role) that allows them to access certain rooms (actions) in the building (system). For example, a manager might have a master key (admin role) and can go everywhere, while regular employees might only have keys to their workspace. It keeps things organized and secure, making sure people can only enter the places they should.
