## Access Control (ACL)
### 5 steps to RBAC
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that defines and manages access to resources based on user roles. It helps enforce the principle of least privilege by granting permissions only to authorized roles, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. RBAC simplifies access management, improves efficiency, and ensures compliance with regulations and policies.
2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
    In a general RBAC hierarchy, you could have the following roles and permissions:
    1. Super Administrator: Has unrestricted access and control over all system resources, including user management, configuration settings, and system-wide permissions.
    2. Administrator: Manages access and permissions for different functional areas or departments within the organization.
    3. Manager: Oversees specific teams or projects, with the ability to assign tasks, view relevant reports, and access resources within their assigned area.
    4. Employee: Has access to resources and permissions necessary for their job role, such as creating and editing documents, accessing certain databases, and participating in specific workflows.
    5. Guest/Visitor: Limited access to public information or specific areas of the system, allowing them to view certain content or attend meetings without the ability to make changes or access sensitive data.
    Note: The actual roles and permissions may vary depending on the organization's structure, industry, and specific operational requirements. RBAC allows for fine-grained control over access rights, and the hierarchy can be customized to meet the needs of the organization.
3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
    To implement RBAC, you can follow these steps:
    1. Identify roles: Analyze the organization's structure and job functions to identify distinct roles that require different levels of access.
    2. Define permissions: Determine the specific actions, operations, or resources that each role needs to perform their job effectively.
    3. Assign roles and permissions: Map roles to corresponding permissions and assign them to individual users or groups based on their job responsibilities.
    4. Implement access controls: Utilize access control mechanisms, such as access control lists, role-based policies, or attribute-based access control, to enforce the assigned roles and permissions.
    5. Regularly review and update: Continuously review and update role assignments and permissions as the organization evolves, ensuring that access privileges remain aligned with users' roles and responsibilities.

1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
    Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform after successful authentication. It verifies whether an authenticated user has the necessary privileges or permissions to perform a specific action or access certain resources within a system or application. In other words, while authentication establishes the identity of a user, authorization controls what that user can do or access based on their authenticated identity.
2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
    The three primary rules defined for RBAC are:
    1. Role assignment: Users are assigned specific roles based on their job responsibilities or functional requirements within the organization.
    2. Role permission: Each role is associated with a set of permissions or privileges that define the actions, operations, or resources accessible to users in that role.
    3. Role authorization: Access is granted or denied based on the roles assigned to users. Users are authorized to perform actions or access resources based on the permissions associated with their assigned roles, while restricting unauthorized access beyond their role's scope.
3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
    RBAC is like assigning different roles to people in a group project. Each role has specific tasks they can do, and they can't do tasks assigned to other roles. It helps organize and control who can access what in a system, ensuring everyone has the right permissions for their role without giving unnecessary access to others.

### RBAC tutorial
1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
    Access rights in RBAC are associated with roles, not individual users. Roles define a set of permissions or access rights that are required to perform specific tasks or access certain resources within a system. Users are then assigned to roles based on their job responsibilities or functional requirements. By associating access rights with roles, RBAC simplifies access management, as permissions can be assigned or revoked at the role level rather than individually for each user. This allows for easier administration and maintenance, especially in large organizations where user turnover or role changes are common.
2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
    Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully authenticates or proves their identity through a login process. Once the user's identity is verified, the system grants access based on the user's assigned roles and associated permissions, allowing them to perform authorized actions or access specific resources within the system.
3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
    RBAC benefits a business by:
    1. Enhancing security: RBAC ensures that users have only the necessary access privileges, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
    2. Streamlining access management: RBAC simplifies user provisioning, role assignments, and permission changes, improving operational efficiency and reducing administrative overhead.
    3. Ensuring compliance: RBAC helps businesses meet regulatory requirements by enforcing access controls, tracking user activities, and maintaining audit trails for accountability and compliance purposes.
