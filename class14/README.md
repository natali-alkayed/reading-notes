## Event Driven Architecture
Two general project ideas related to event-driven architecture:

1. Real-time Data Processing System: Build a system that ingests and processes real-time data streams. You can use event-driven architecture to handle events such as data updates, notifications, or user actions. For example, you could develop a real-time analytics platform that processes incoming data streams, performs aggregations or calculations, and provides real-time insights or visualizations.

2. Event-driven Microservices: Create a microservices-based application using event-driven architecture. Divide the application into small, independent services that communicate through events. Each service can listen to relevant events and respond accordingly, enabling a highly decoupled and scalable system. For instance, you could develop an e-commerce application where services handle events like user registrations, order placements, or inventory updates.
