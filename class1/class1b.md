## Prep - Data Structures and Algorith <a name="DataStructuresandAlgorith"></a>

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
 to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed


2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
every recursive function should has tow parts : the base case and the recursive case , the recursive case is wjen the function calls it self.The base case is when the function doesnt call itself agian...by dividing the function to tow these ats,the infint lopp wll not exsist.

### Recursion : is used in many algorithms ,is abuilding block.
recursion has tow parts: base case and recursive case .
## psoudo code : is a high level describtion of the problem ,you are trying to solve in code..its written like code ,but its meant to be closer to humen speech.
people use recursion since it often makes code easier to understand and look cleaner.

### Data structer: 
1. linked list : is something called an (node) which contains a value and apointer ,the value is something as simple as a number.and that number will simply connect you to the next node.
the first node in the list is known as a (head) while the last node known as (tail).

2. array.
3. hash table,it is an object in javascribt.
4. stack and queue: they are similler and they are both kind of built on top of arrays with a few additional features.
5. graphs and trees: basically they are kind of similar to a linked list where you have nodes that are pointing to other nodes.

### Big O :
is assentionally an equation that describs scales with respect to some input variables.
