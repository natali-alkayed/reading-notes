Choosing the State Structure
1. Summarize the five principles for structuring state.

In computer science, particularly in the context of managing the state of an application, there are five key principles for structuring state effectively:

1. Single Source of Truth (SSOT): This principle suggests that the entire state of an application should be stored in a single, centralized location. This makes it easier to manage, update, and synchronize the state across different components. In most cases, this centralized source is an object or data structure.

2. State is Read-Only: According to this principle, components within the application should not directly modify the state. Instead, they request changes by dispatching actions or events. This helps maintain predictability and ensures that changes to the state are properly tracked and controlled.

3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions: The state modifications are typically carried out by pure functions called reducers. These reducers take the current state and an action as inputs, and they produce a new state as output. Pure functions ensure that state modifications are predictable, testable, and do not cause side effects.

These reducers take the current state and an action as inputs, and they produce a new state as output. Pure functions ensure that state modifications are predictable, testable, and do not cause side effects.

5. History and Time Travel: This principle involves preserving the history of state changes. By maintaining a record of actions or events that lead to state modifications, it becomes possible to implement features like undo/redo functionality or debugging with time-traveling capabilities. This is particularly useful when debugging and understanding the flow of an application’s state changes.
Passing State Deeply with Context
What problem do Contexts aim to solve?

Contexts in software development aim to address the problem of efficiently passing data, configuration settings, and other information down the component tree without having to manually pass props through every intermediate component. They provide a way to share state and behavior at a global or controlled scope, simplifying communication between components and reducing prop drilling.

2. What is one technique to try before useContext?

One technique to consider before using useContext is prop drilling, where you pass data and functions through component props to child components. While it’s straightforward, it can become cumbersome in deeply nested component trees. If prop drilling becomes unwieldy, then using useContext can offer a more elegant solution for managing shared state without excessive prop passing.

3. What hook complements useContext for complex applications?

The useReducer hook complements useContext in complex applications. While useContext helps manage shared state, useReducer provides a structured way to handle state transitions through actions and reducers, which can be beneficial for managing more intricate state logic within the context.
